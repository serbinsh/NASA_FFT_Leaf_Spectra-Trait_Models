# NASA_FFT_Leaf_Spectra-Trait_Models
Leaf spectra-trait PLSR models to estimate foliar functional traits from fresh leaf spectroscopy data.  The models were developed using data collected as part of the NASA Forest Functional Types (FFT) project (Serbin et al. 2014)


## Contains:
1) The PLSR model coefficients

2) R script vignettes showing how to apply the PLSR models to new observations
